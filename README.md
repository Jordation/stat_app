# tools i have learned for and am using for this project

- python
	- beautiful soup - web scraper
	- sqlalchemy - db queries and schema
	- pandas - not settled on how or where I want to use pandas, seems mostly useful to me when dealing with isolated data (match input), otherwise I'll mostly be harvesting an event of data at a time and using SQLA to inser that into my SQLite DB appropriately 
- flask
- js
	- plotly
	-chartJS might be replacing plotly as it doesn't play nice with next.js which I am now using
	- react	
- tailwind


## things i want to try

- svelte
	- svelte graphing package 
- [x] not using CRA 
- typescript
