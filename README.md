# current to-do / goals
- Multiple datasets
	- User should be able to specify n queries, configure each and receieve a single graph with all unique datasets mapped to it (i.e. stacked/grouped bar chart)
- Better queries 
	- Just need to do more testing and figure out what feels good 
- How the fuck do i use css
- Better component structure
	- My knowledge is growing so quickly as I learn these tools and I am in a constant state of wanting to overhaul, my components don't *fit* together very well and I want to re-structure them. 
	- Figure out what needs to be grouped with what and who does NOT need to be grouped 
		- Who needs props from who
	






## tools i have learned for and am using for this project

- python
	- beautiful soup - web scraper
	- sqlalchemy - db queries and schema
	- pandas - not settled on how or where I want to use pandas, seems mostly useful to me when dealing with isolated data (match input), otherwise I'll mostly be harvesting an event of data at a time and using SQLA to inser that into my SQLite DB appropriately 
- flask
- js
	- plotly
	-chartJS might be replacing plotly as it doesn't play nice with next.js which I am now using
	- react	
- tailwind


## things i want to try

- svelte
	- svelte graphing package 
- [x] not using CRA 
- typescript
